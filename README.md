## License Choice Explanation

Hello,

The licensing framework chosen for this project is the **Apache License 2.0**. This license was chosen considering the compatibility with the open-source library anime.js.

The Apache License 2.0 enables individuals like myself to utilize, modify, and distribute this project while adhering to specified conditions. It provides legal protection and flexibility for both contributors and users, enabling protections for developers.

The choice to use the Apache License 2.0 is based, as established early on, on its compatibility with the MIT License, which `anime.js` utilizes. 

The choice of an alternative license demonstrates understanding. By choosing this license, I aim to represent a general understanding of license use and how to properly consider the licenses of included libraries.

In addition, this displays an understanding of the rights and obligations outlined by the MIT License.

Sincerely,
Grace Anders
